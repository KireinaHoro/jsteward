		The difference between aiozmq and vanilla pyzmq (zmq.asyncio).

		zmq.asyncio works only by replacement event loop with custom one. This approach works but have two disadvantages:

			zmq.asyncio.ZMQEventLoop cannot be combined with other loop implementations (most notable is ultra fast uvloop).

			It uses internal ZMQ Poller which has fast ZMQ Sockets support but doesn't intended to work fast with many (thousands) regular TCP sockets.
